"""Scripts to generate `bavapi` Reference classes.

These reference classes make it easier to filter results
by mapping commonly used IDs to human-readable options.

To generate reference classes you will need a WPPBAV Fount API token.
Please see the authentication section of the documentation for more info:
<https://developer.wppbav.com/docs/2.x/intro>

As well as the `bavapi` documentation on Authentication:
