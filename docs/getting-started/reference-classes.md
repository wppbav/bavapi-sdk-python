# Installing `bavapi` *Reference* classes

`bavapi` can generate some convenience reference classes which map Fount resource IDs with a more readable name, both for ease of use and for autocompletion in IDEs.

These classes are automatically generated by a console command that becomes available once `bavapi` is installed.

!!! info "Protected Access"
    A Fount API token is required to generate reference files. See the [Authentication](authentication.md) section for more information and instructions for using `.env` files.

As of `v0.10` the following reference classes will be generated in a folder named `bavapi_refs`:

- `Audiences`: encodes audience IDs
- `Countries`: encodes country IDs

A sample reference class would look like this:

```py
class Audiences(Enum):
    ALL_ADULTS = 27  # Random ID
    ...
```

And could be used to have better visibility when filtering API responses:

=== "Using Reference class"

    ```py title="Explicit audience filter"
    bavapi.brandscape_data(country_code="US", year=2022, audiences=Audiences.ALL_ADULTS)
    ```

=== "Not using Reference class"

    ```py title="Audience filter not human-readable"
    bavapi.brandscape_data(country_code="US", year=2022, audiences=27)
    ```

!!! warning
    Don't commit reference classes to public repositories. Add `bavapi_refs/` to your `.gitignore` file.

## Generate Reference classes

!!! abstract "New in `v0.7.0`"

To generate these reference classes, there are two options for authenticating your requests:

- Specify the Fount API token via the `-t`/`--token` argument
- Use a `.env` file to store your Fount API token as the `BAV_API_KEY` environment variable, and install `python-dotenv` to read the file into your environment. See the [Authentication](authentication.md#recommended-way-to-manage-api-keys) section for more info.

To generate the reference files, run the following command:

=== "With a `.env` file"

    ```prompt
    bavapi-gen-refs --all
    ```

=== "Using the `-t`/`--token` argument"

    ```prompt
    bavapi-gen-refs -t "TOKEN" --all
    ```

You can also specify the name of the reference class to generate:

```prompt
bavapi-gen-refs -t "TOKEN" --name audiences
```

To update existing reference classes with the latest data, re-run `bavapi-gen-refs` with the appropriate parameters on your terminal.
