    "## Motivation\n",
    "\n",
    "The reason for using `bavapi` is that, while the Fount API provides a way to programmatically access BAV data, it is primarily intended for integrating BAV data into web applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "This means that the way the data is provided makes it a bit harder to use in data science analysis:\n",
    "\n",
    "- The data is delivered in JSON format, which has to be parsed into a DataFrame.\n",
    "- Some of the data is composed of nested dictionaries, which makes it a bit harder to parse.\n",
    "- The data is delivered in a paginated form, meaning that it is chunked into batches of 25 rows by default. A typical BSS would take about 35 requests to get all data at 25 rows per request.\n",
    "\n",
    "`bavapi` provides a simple solution to get this data in a workable format for data science workflows."
